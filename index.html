      The promise of Cake is introduced by GLaDOS as an incentive for Chell to
      complete the test chambers in the original Portal. It is referenced in
      many of the Rattmann's dens as "a lie", sparking the internet meme "The
      Cake is a lie". The Cake can be seen at the end of Portal in a room
      surrounded with waking Personality Cores and the Companion Cube.
