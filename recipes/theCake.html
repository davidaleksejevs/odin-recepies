    <h3>Story</h3>
    <p>
      The cake is spoken of frequently throughout Portal. It is often mentioned
      through dialogue as well as Rattmann's wall art in his dens. Although the
      dens frequently claim that the cake is in fact a lie, the ending of Portal
      shows the actual cake. This implies that GLaDOS really hid the cake very
      well for "Cake and Refreshments". The cake is also mentioned on the
      monitors in the escape sequence (in the midst of gibberish, you will find
      some cake recipes mixed).

    <h3>recipe</h3>
    <p>
      Recipe In addition to the simple mention of the Cake, an actual recipe is
      given. The recipe can be found on several computer screens after Chell's
      escape from death. Additionally, during the battle with GLaDOS, the
      Intelligence Core will recite the recipe for the Cake. The recipe often
      contains unusual (e.g. "candy coated peanut butter pieces, shaped like
      fish") or potentially lethal (e.g. "cranial caps") ingredients.
