    <h3>Story</h3>
    <p>
      1-Up Mushrooms (sometimes parsed as 1 up Mushrooms,[1] Extra Life
      Mushrooms,[2] 1UP Mushrooms,[3] or 1-UP Mushrooms[4]) are green mushrooms
      that give the player an extra life. They are usually the rarest mushrooms,
      but they can still be found in almost every game a Super Mushroom has
      appeared in, and even some it has not. 1-Up Mushrooms are usually found in
      hidden blocks or in risky places for the player. They always grant the
      player a positive effect when collected. The above text is from the Super
